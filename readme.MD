### <a href="https://covaware.pythonanywhere.com/"> Be prepared with Covaware </a>

It started off as a project given to us by our school and we got an idea! Why not use the opportunity to spread awareness amongst people ? 

Covaware aims at equipping everyone with the right information required to prevent and deal with COVID-19. Covaware also includes host of other features and information related to COVID-19 such as
- The common strains
- Vaccination options
- Updates on daily cases and recoveries worldwide and in India

 It took us quite a while to make this website , and we hope it helps you find all the information you need !
